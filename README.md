# ds-save-manager
Save file manager for Dark Souls

# Description
In Dark Souls, every action you take has permanent consequences. Accidentally angered Frampt? No way to bring him back. Accidentally triggered Laurentius's jealousy by telling him that Quelana taught you more about pyromancy than he could? No way to stop him from going hollow.

No more! Now you can save your progress at any time and reload from any save file you've made with `ds_save_manager.py`.
